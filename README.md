This project demonstrates how to predict employee attrition (whether an employee will leave or stay) using a machine learning model called Random Forest. The code loads an employee dataset, processes it by converting categorical data to numbers, and then uses Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance more reliably. It provides detailed classification metrics and visualizes results with a confusion matrix heatmap. Finally, the code trains a final model on the full dataset and identifies the most important features affecting attrition. This approach helps organizations understand key factors behind employee turnover and improve retention strategies.
